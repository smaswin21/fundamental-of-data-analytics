# Fundamentals of Data Analytics

## Project Overview

This repository contains the findings and analysis of a research project conducted as part of the "Fundamentals of Data Analytics" course. The aim of this project was to analyze the impact of income taxes and other independent variables in the European Union on economic growth. The analysis focused on evaluating GDP growth and GDP per capita to understand the relationship between income tax rates and economic outcomes.

## Abstract

This study explores the relationship between income tax rates and economic growth in the European Union. We examine the influence of income tax rates on GDP per capita and GDP growth rate, seeking to answer whether low or high-income tax rates have an impact on economic growth. Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset and employs statistical techniques, including ANOVA, to investigate these relationships.

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis:** Income taxes have a negative effect on economic growth.
  This hypothesis assumes that higher income taxes are associated with lower levels of economic growth for both GDP per capita and GDP growth rate.

- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Income taxes have a positive effect on economic growth.
  This hypothesis suggests that lower income taxes are linked to higher levels of economic growth for both GDP per capita and GDP growth rate.

## Methodology

We conducted an extensive literature review in 2021 to support our analysis, relying on recent research findings and relevant articles. The research considered additional variables, such as unemployment, and their effects on GDP growth and GDP per capita. Statistical tests, including ANOVA, were used to assess the significance of these variables.

## Key Findings

- The analysis revealed that income tax rates had a significant impact on GDP per capita.
- Unemployment had no statistically significant impact on GDP per capita, but an interaction effect with income tax rates was observed.
- The results emphasize the complexity of economic relationships and the need to consider multiple factors.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this research sheds light on the intricate relationship between income tax rates and economic outcomes. While income taxes were found to impact GDP per capita, the direction of the effect depended on various influencing factors. This analysis provides a foundation for further investigation and policymaking in understanding the impact of income tax laws on economic outcomes.

## Note

In retrospect, it could be beneficial to include qualitative variables and employ regression techniques for a more comprehensive analysis.
